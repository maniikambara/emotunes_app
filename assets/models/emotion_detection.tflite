# This is a placeholder TFLite model file
# In a real implementation, this would be replaced with a properly trained model
# The model should have the following specifications:
# - Input: 224x224x3 RGB image
# - Output: 6 emotion classes (happy, sad, energetic, calm, angry, neutral)
# - Architecture: MobileNetV2 or similar efficient model for mobile devices

# Note: This is just a text placeholder. In reality, this would be a binary TFLite model file.
# The actual model should be trained on a facial expression dataset and converted to TFLite format.
